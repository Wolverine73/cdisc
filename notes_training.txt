SDTM Validation and Quality Check
https://www.amarexcro.com/resources/chaos-to-clarity-journey-converting-raw-data-into-sdtm-datasets



difference between sdtm and sdtmig

in simpler terms... SDTM is the blueprint, 
and SDTMIG is the instruction manual for building the data structure based on that blueprint

While both SDTM and SDTMIG are standards used to organize clinical 
trial data, SDTM is the core model defining the standard structure for data 
organization, while SDTMIG acts as an implementation guide that provides
specific details on how to format and structure SDTM datasets for clinical 
trial tabulations, essentially providing practical guidance on applying the
SDTM model in real-world scenarios; 

Medtronic Post-Approval Network (PAN)..........................
The Medtronic Post-Approval Network (PAN) is a global network of hospitals, clinics,
and clinicians that conducts post-market surveillance of Medtronic cardiac rhythm 
products. The PAN Registry is a patient-centric platform that collects data about 
patients and their health to monitor the performance of Medtronic devices. 

Is post market surveillance phase 4..............................
These trials look for side effects that were not seen in earlier trials and may also 
study how well a new treatment works over a long period of time. Post-marketing surveillance 
trials may include thousands of people. Also called phase 4 clinical trial and phase IV clinical trial.

ADSL........................
In CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium), "ADSL" refers to the "Analysis 
Data Model Subject-Level Analysis Dataset," which is a core component of the ADaM (Analysis
Data Model) framework, used to standardize and present subject-level data for clinical 
trial analysis, making it the primary dataset used for analysis within the ADaM standard. 

A clinical arm is a group of participants in a clinical trial who receive 
a specific treatment or no treatment, as per the trial's protocol. 

There are different types of clinical arms, including:

	Experimental arm: Receives an experimental drug 
	Control arm: Receives an active comparator, placebo comparator, sham comparator, or no intervention 
	Treatment arm: Also known as the treatment group, this is the group of participants that receives the treatment under investigation 



In CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium), a "Statistical Analysis Plan" (SAP) 
is a detailed document that outlines the exact statistical methods and procedures that will 
be used to analyze data collected during a clinical trial, ensuring transparency and reproducibility 
in the interpretation of results; it specifies which data will be analyzed, the patient populations
to be assessed, and the statistical methods to be applied, essentially acting as a blueprint for
the data analysis process within a clinical trial. 

Key points about SAP in CDISC:

Purpose:
To clearly define how clinical trial data will be analyzed, including population selection, 
analysis methods, and how results will be presented, ensuring consistency and adherence to 
regulatory standards. 

Content:
The SAP typically includes details like primary and secondary endpoints, statistical tests 
to be used, data transformations, missing data handling strategies, and planned analysis
populations. 

Importance in CDISC:
By using standardized CDISC standards, particularly the ADaM (Analysis Dataset Model), 
researchers can ensure that the data is properly formatted and ready for analysis according 
to the specifications outlined in the SAP. 

Relationship with other documents:
The SAP is closely linked to the clinical trial protocol, as it provides the statistical 
details behind the trial design and objectives.

every clinical investigation begins wtih the development of clinical protocol.
the protocol is a document that describes how a clinical trial will be conducted
(the objectives, design, methodology, statistical considerations, and 
organization of a clinical trial, ) and ensures the saftey of the trial subjects
and integrity of the data collected.

a research protocol is a document that describers the background, rationale, objectives

	saftey efficacy
	
	SDTM efficacy domains include Endpoints, Laboratory (LB), 
	and Vital Sign (VS) domains. These domains capture information 
	about the effectiveness of the study intervention. 


clinical programming requires a programmer to understand
	the objective of the clinical trial study
	its phases
	the study design, etc.
	
the 1st step in initiating a clinical trial is writing the protocol.  this is done by
either the sponsor or the contract research organization (cro)

in every trial, the protocol is prepared with the help of the clinician and the biostatistician.
after the investigator receives the protocol, they will determine the feasibility of 
conducting the clinical trial.

	the integrity of the collected data
	
	why the clinical trial protocol needed?
	the protocol is a key QC tool for the all aspects of a clinical trial,
	being necessary for serveral reasons...
		it ensures the health and safety of all the study participants
		it provides a precise study plan
		it defines and manages the trial and therefore it should be strictly followed by all study investigators
		it gaurantees integrity of data, allowing combination and compare of data across all investigators or study sites

sdtm guidelines

	1. domain name can only contain 2 characters
		observation - rows in ad dataset are consistent of a series of named variables
	2. every domain should have a proper label
		label = dm = description / overview for the demographics domain model
		domain - collection of observations on a particular topic
	3. variable names will not excee 8 characters long
		variable - column in a dataset... variables can be classified according to role
	4. final output should be in compliance with sdtm IG 3.2
		role - describes type of information by the variable and how used
	5. all sdtm date variables are of character data type
		yymmdd10.
		is8601da. = 2024-12-25
		is8601dt. = 2024-12-25T21:00:00

special purpose domain

	DM - demographics
	
	subject
	topic variable - SUBJID
	identifier variable - STUDYID, DOMAIN, SIIBKOD
	record qualifier variable - gender, age,dob
	dates - icf signed date, treatment start date, treatment end date, death date

	USUBJID = derived by concatenation of STUDYID + SITEID + SUBJID
	
	RFSTDTC - equivalent to date/time when subject was first exposed to study treatment.
	


RFXSTDTC
	date time of first study treatmet
	what is difference between RFXSTDTC vs RFSTDTC
	
		entire study start date and time in char format
		example 1
			study drug - fever
			he is having vomiting sesation
			first we provide drug to control vomit only after that we go with study drug
			vomit (support treatment) - 4/10/2022 = RFXSTDTC
			fever (study treatment)   - 4/11/2022 = RFSTDTC
			
			if subject doesnt go for any support treatment - in that case
			RFXSTDTC = RFSTDTC
		
		example 2
			multi center study / multi national study
			RFXSTDTC = subject had a treatment in site1
			RFSTDTC  = and same subject different treatment in site2 considering a washout period
	
		RFXSTDTC - First date/time of exposure to any protocol-specified 
		treatment or therapy, equal to the earliest value of EXSTDTC.
		
		RFSTDTC - Reference start date/time for the subject in ISO 8601 character format. 
		Usually equivalent to date/time when subject was first exposed to study treatment. 
		See assumption 9 for additional detail on when RFSTDTC may be null.


RFXENDTC
	study treatment end date and time in char format
	example
		SUBJID		SEX		RFXSTDTC	RFSTDTC		RFXENDTC	RFENDTC
		111		M		2022-03-01	2022-03-02	2022-03-16	2022-03-16

		orthonet:
			problem - burning knee cap
				RFXSTDTC = 2022-03-01 = injecting gel in knee cap 	(original treatment)
				RFSTDTC  = 2022-03-10 = knee replacement 		(study treatment)
				RFXENDTC = 2022-03-16 = healing medicine		(study treatment ended)
			follow up
				RFENDTC  = 2022-03-30 = supporting medicine		(compelete treatment ended)

RFPENDTC
	reference end participation date and time char
		study completion date
		follow up date
		death date
		discontinue date
		
	example - subject starts on 2022-03-01 and stops... this becomes end participation date - RFPENDTC

	example
		SUBJID		SEX		RFXSTDTC	RFSTDTC		RFXENDTC	RFENDTC		RFPENDTC
		111		M		2022-03-01	2022-03-02	2022-03-16	2022-03-16	2022-03-16

		
		after RFXENDTC - 2022-03-16 the hospital doesnt need any more visits then RFXENDTC = RFENDTC + RFPENDTC

		the patient doesnt attend follow up after RFSTDTC so no RFENDTC + RFPENDTC
		SUBJID		SEX		RFXSTDTC	RFSTDTC		RFXENDTC	RFENDTC		RFPENDTC
		222		F		2022-03-01	2022-03-10	2022-03-16			
		
		so then RFENDTC = RFXENDTC
		the patient doesnt attend follow up so no value for RFXENDTC becomes RFPENDTC
		SUBJID		SEX		RFXSTDTC	RFSTDTC		RFXENDTC	RFENDTC		RFPENDTC
