clinical data transformation: crf to sdtm - https://github.com/Vijayalakshmi30/SAS-Projects---SDTM

	Clinical Data Transformation: CRF to SDTM
	This repository contains SAS scripts and workflows developed for transforming raw Case Report Form (CRF) data into the 
	standardized Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) format. The project includes data transformations for critical clinical 
	domains, including Demographics (DM), Vital Signs (VS), Exposure (EX), Medical History (MH), and Disposition (DS). 
	Each program adheres to CDISC standards to ensure data consistency, accuracy, and interoperability for clinical trials.

	Overview
	This project contains SAS code and processes for transforming raw clinical data collected from Case Report Forms (CRF) 
	into the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) format. This conversion ensures data consistency and standardization 
	for use in clinical trial analysis and regulatory submissions. The repository includes transformations for the following domains:

	DM: Demographics
	VS: Vital Signs
	EX: Exposure
	MH: Medical History
	DS: Disposition
	Each program follows the CDISC standards, facilitating interoperability and compliance for data reporting and submission.

	Project Details
	DM (Demographics): Converts participant demographic data, including age, gender, and ethnicity, into the SDTM-compliant structure.
	VS (Vital Signs): Transforms vital signs measurements, such as blood pressure and heart rate, ensuring standardized units and format.
	EX (Exposure): Tracks participant exposure to treatments or interventions, ensuring precise records of dosing and administration.
	MH (Medical History): Standardizes patient medical history, organizing records for consistency across clinical analysis.
	DS (Disposition): Summarizes participant disposition information, including withdrawal, completion, or other statuses.
	
clinical data analysis: sdtm to adam transformation - https://github.com/Vijayalakshmi30/SAS-Projects---ADaM	

	Clinical Data Analysis: SDTM to ADaM Transformation
	This repository features SAS code for converting Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) data into Analysis Data Model (ADaM)
	datasets, including domains for Adverse Events (ADAE), Exposure (ADEX), Time-to-Event (ADTTE), and Subject-Level Analysis 
	(ADSL). Each transformation adheres to CDISC standards, enabling consistent, high-quality clinical data analysis.

	Overview
	This project contains SAS programs and workflows to transform clinical trial data from the Study Data Tabulation Model 
	(SDTM) format to the Analysis Data Model (ADaM) format, aligning with CDISC standards. The transformation supports 
	clinical data analysis for regulatory submission and reporting.

	The repository includes transformations for the following ADaM domains:

	ADAE: Adverse Events Analysis
	ADEX: Exposure Analysis
	ADTTE: Time-to-Event Analysis
	ADSL: Subject-Level Analysis

	Project Details
	ADAE (Adverse Events Analysis): Aggregates adverse event data, aligning with ADaM standards to support safety analysis.
	ADEX (Exposure Analysis): Prepares dosing and exposure data to allow for comprehensive treatment assessments.
	ADTTE (Time-to-Event Analysis): Converts survival or event-time data, structured for time-to-event analysis in clinical trials.
	ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis): Produces subject-level data containing demographic and baseline information required for study analysis.
